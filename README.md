# Valorant Project 
Dashboard with stats from teams and players of Valorant Champions Tour 2022

Valorant is a tactical FPS (First Person Shooter) computer game that innovated in the gaming industry by bringing fun and challenging for players. It was developed by Riot Games (Company with experience in other games), which brought a combination of concepts from others FPS games, added to the introduction of mystical elements, specific abilities of each character, maps and game lore.

I made a project that presents some teams's stats of the participants of Valorant Champions Tour 2022! I used 3 tools to ETL data (axiom.ai, Python and Power BI). The purpose of this study was to show a way to help coaches and analysts of valorant's staff make decisions based on data, through statistics and data visualization.
